# Accurate numerical modeling, uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of ion concentration dynamics in brain tissue 

This code was used to produce the results presented in my master thesis work. 
The model studied was presented in SÃ¦tra et al., *PLoS Computational Biology*, 17(7), e1008143 (2021): 
[An electrodiffusive neuron-extracellular-glia model for exploring
the genesis of slow potentials in the brain](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008143). 

The code was developed on top of the followings: 
- https://github.com/CINPLA/edNEGmodel_analysis

# Installation

To install the code, clone or download the repo, navigate to the top directory of the repo and enter the following command
in the terminal: 
```bash
python setup.py install
```

The code was run with Windows 10 Home and Python 3.8.16.
